## Codesoft Internship Projects

### Overview

During my internship at Codesoft as a Python Developer, I completed several projects that helped me enhance my programming skills and gain practical experience. These projects include a GUI calculator, a to-do list GUI, and a rock-paper-scissors game.

### Projects

1. **GUI Calculator**
   - A simple, user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) calculator.
   - Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
   - Built using Python and the Tkinter library.

2. **To-Do List GUI**
   - A graphical user interface for managing a to-do list.
   - Allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
   - Built using Python and the Tkinter library.

3. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game**
   - A classic rock-paper-scissors game with a graphical user interface.
   - Users can play against the computer, and the game keeps track of the score.
   - Built using Python and the Tkinter library.
